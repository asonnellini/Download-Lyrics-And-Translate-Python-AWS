
# This script uses Selenium - https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/
# "Selenium is many things but at its core, it is a toolset for web browser automation that uses the best techniques available 
# to remotely control browser instances and emulate a userâ€™s interaction with the browser." (quote from Selenium.dev)

# Example as to how use Selenium:
# https://towardsdatascience.com/controlling-the-web-with-python-6fceb22c5f08


# WHY did I need selenium?
# Navigating the website lyrics.com I realized the URL address for a song may be different depending on how you land on the page 
# that has the lyrics.
# For example, both the below 2 links lead to the same web page (for the same song):
# https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/23408014
# https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/36308128/Dire+Straits/Money+for+Nothing
# Also, please note the random (i.e. I do not know how it is generated) number between /lyrics/ and /Dire+Straits/Money+for+Nothing
# Because of that random number, I cannot build directly a valid URL from the couple [name artist, name song], i.e.
# the following url does not work: https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/Dire+Straits/Money+for+Nothing
# I need to mimic the steps I would do using a browser to search for a lyrics of my interest, namely:
# - Navigate to the website www.lyrics.com
# - Search for an artist in the searchbox 
#   - Select the option "search by artist"
#   - Type the name of the artist
#   - Click on Search
# - Click on the link of the artist that matches your search
# - Search in the landing page the song of your interest (this webpage displays all songs from the artist)
